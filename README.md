# Mc-Jars

## <span style="color:red">Warning!</span>

This Project is very much in an experimental state,
so expect Large changes/Breaking Changes!

## What is this project?

This project is the result of 1 single unhappy individual
about the very unfortunate downfall of a very nice mc server
jar platform called [serverjars](https://serverjars.com).

## Why?

I love using random api's in my apps and projects, and this
one in particular was used in a very simple project I made
which is found here https://github.com/KalebSchmidlkofer/mcc
And I've been using that project in real life to fetch jars
and download them. Recently though, serverjars had some issues
with their website, mainly being nobody knows how to maintain
it properly. Naturally the website started to break, slowly but
surely, and now the resembles a ghost of it's former self.
That being said, I knew their had to be a better way, a maintainable
way. So I decided to use the one skill I have spent the last 5 years
honing, and after a long thought-out process, I decided to use one of 
Python's greatest web libraries django to create a better alternative.

## The Plan

In order for this to be a good replacement for serverjars, it need to offer
the same features and ease-of use. In order to do that I need a few simple things.
namely

- [ ] api
- [ ] Good looking Frontend
- [ ] Fast, Efficient and Automated way to get new server jars uploaded to the website
